# Staff Hub — mobile app (iOS & Android)

The staff app is packaged for the stores with **Capacitor**: the same React code you
already have runs inside a native iOS/Android shell, so there is one codebase, not
three. This file covers what's done, how to run it, and what still has to happen
before either store will accept it.

## What changed to make it a real mobile app

| Before | Now |
|---|---|
| A drawn phone (frame, notch, fake clock and battery) shown *inside* the real phone | Full-screen app on a handset; the decorative phone is kept **only** on desktop, where it's a useful demo |
| Fixed 390×820px — clipped on an iPhone SE, 201px of stray scrolling | Fills the device, no page scrolling, no horizontal overflow on any size tested |
| No notch/home-indicator handling | `viewport-fit=cover` + `env(safe-area-inset-*)` on the header and footer |
| Tailwind from the Play CDN (needs internet on every launch) | Compiled at build time into a 39 kB stylesheet — works offline |
| No manifest, icons, or theme colour | `manifest.webmanifest`, SVG + PNG icons (incl. Android maskable), theme colour, Apple touch icon |
| API fixed to `localhost:4000` | Follows the host the app was opened from; `VITE_API_URL` overrides |

Verified at 375×667 (iPhone SE), 393×852 (iPhone 14 Pro), 412×915 (Pixel 7) and
360×740 (Galaxy S8): **fits exactly, no scrolling, no horizontal overflow.**

## Running it

### On this machine (web, as before)
```bash
npm run dev            # from the project root
```

### On a real phone over your wifi — no packaging needed
1. Find this machine's IP: `ipconfig` → the IPv4 address, e.g. `192.168.1.5`
2. Start the client so it listens on the network:
   ```bash
   npm --workspace client run dev:lan
   ```
3. On the phone, open `http://192.168.1.5:5173`

The client works out that the API is on `http://192.168.1.5:4000` automatically —
that's what the host-following logic in `client/src/api.js` is for. Your laptop and
phone must be on the same network, and Windows Firewall may prompt to allow Node.

### Android (a real app)
Needs **Android Studio** (with the Android SDK) — free, and it runs on Windows.
```bash
npm --workspace client run android
```
That builds the web assets, syncs them into the native project, and opens Android
Studio. Press ▶ to run on an emulator or a plugged-in phone.

> **Set the API URL first.** A packaged app cannot use `localhost` — that means the
> phone itself. Create `client/.env.production`:
> ```
> VITE_API_URL="http://192.168.1.5:4000/api"
> ```
> (Your machine's LAN IP while testing; your real HTTPS domain once hosted.)
> Android also blocks plain HTTP by default — for local testing only, allow it for
> your IP via a network-security config, or use HTTPS.

### iOS
```bash
npm --workspace client run ios
```
⚠️ **This cannot be built on Windows.** Xcode is macOS-only. The `client/ios`
project is generated and ready, but to build, run on a device, or submit to the App
Store you need either a Mac, or a cloud Mac service (Codemagic, Ionic Appflow,
Bitrise — roughly £30–90/month).

## Before the stores will accept it

### Both stores
- [ ] **Host the backend** with a real domain and HTTPS. Both platforms block plain
      HTTP by default (iOS App Transport Security, Android cleartext policy).
- [ ] **Move off SQLite** to PostgreSQL — one line in `server/prisma/schema.prisma`.
- [ ] **Privacy policy** at a public URL. Required by both.
- [ ] **App icons and splash screens** — the PNGs here are placeholders generated
      from `client/public/icon.svg`. Re-run `node scripts/make-icons.mjs` after
      replacing the SVG with the college's real logo.
- [x] ~~**Account deletion inside the app.**~~ **Done.** Staff App → **More** →
      *Delete my account*. Requires the password, an authenticator code where 2FA is
      on, and the word DELETE typed out. Removes the profile, check-ins, leave,
      adjustments, notifications, reset tokens and the sign-up record; shared
      documents survive and assigned ones are detached. The last remaining
      administrator is refused, so the college cannot be locked out of its own
      admin console. Covered by `scripts/smoke-account-deletion.mjs` (26 checks).

### Apple specifically
- [ ] **Guideline 4.2 (Minimum Functionality)** — Apple rejects apps that are just a
      website in a wrapper. **Push notifications are built** (see below); adding
      **biometric unlock** (Face ID / Touch ID) and **offline access** to balances
      and documents would make the case comfortably.
- [ ] Apple Developer Program — £79/year.
- [ ] A Mac (or cloud Mac) for building and submitting.

### Google specifically
- [ ] Play Console account — $25 one-off.
- [ ] Data safety form declaring what you collect (names, emails, attendance).
- [ ] Target API level requirements (Play enforces a recent one).

### Security hardening for a packaged app
- [ ] Move the JWT from `localStorage` to secure storage (`@capacitor/preferences`
      is installed; for real secrecy use a Keychain/Keystore plugin). WebView
      localStorage is app-private but is not the Keychain.
- [ ] Certificate pinning if the college requires it.
- [ ] Shorter token lifetime — 7 days is generous for a mobile app on a lost phone.

## Push notifications

Built and tested end to end **except the final hop to Google**, which needs your own
Firebase project. Until you configure it the app behaves exactly as before — the
in-app bell and email still work, and the server logs what it *would* have pushed.
That's the same pattern as email, so nothing breaks in development.

**What triggers a push:** every existing notification. A staff member gets one when
their leave is approved or declined, when their password is reset, and when an admin
resets their two-step verification. Admins get one when a leave request or a sign-up
arrives. Tapping the notification opens the relevant screen.

### Turning it on

This is the one step nobody can do for you: a Firebase project is tied to a Google
account. Everything either side of it is already built and tested — see
*"What's already proven"* below.

**1 — Create the project** (2 minutes, free)
   - Go to <https://console.firebase.google.com> → **Add project**
   - Name it e.g. `lbc-staff-hub`. Google Analytics is not needed — turn it off.

**2 — Add the Android app** (this is all Android needs)
   - Project overview → the **Android** icon
   - Package name — must match exactly: `uk.ac.lbc.staffhub`
   - Download **`google-services.json`** and put it at:
     ```
     client/android/app/google-services.json
     ```
   - Nothing else to configure: the Gradle plugin is already on the classpath and
     applies itself as soon as that file exists.

**3 — Add the iOS app** (only when you have a Mac and a paid Apple account)
   - Project overview → the **iOS** icon, bundle ID `uk.ac.lbc.staffhub`
   - Download **`GoogleService-Info.plist`** → `client/ios/App/App/`
   - Apple Developer portal → **Keys** → create an *Apple Push Notifications service
     (APNs)* key → download the `.p8`
   - Firebase → *Project settings → Cloud Messaging → APNs Authentication Key* →
     upload the `.p8` with your Key ID and Team ID

**4 — Give the server permission to send**
   - Firebase → *Project settings → **Service accounts*** → **Generate new private key**
   - A JSON file downloads. **Keep it out of the repository** — it can send
     notifications to every one of your users.
   - In `server/.env`:
     ```env
     FCM_PROJECT_ID="lbc-staff-hub"
     FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="C:/secure/path/lbc-staff-hub-firebase-adminsdk.json"
     ```

**5 — Check it**
   ```bash
   node scripts/check-push.mjs                 # validates the credentials
   node scripts/check-push.mjs <device-token>  # sends a real test notification
   ```
   The server banner should change from `console stub` to
   `Firebase project "lbc-staff-hub" as …`.

   To get a device token: run the app on a real device, sign in, then read it from
   the `DeviceToken` table (`npm run studio`).

### What's already proven

`scripts/smoke-push-transport.mjs` (28 checks) verifies the whole Firebase transport
against a generated key and a stand-in for Google, so the only untested link is the
final hop to Google's servers:

- the OAuth assertion is a valid RS256 signature with the right issuer, audience,
  scope and expiry;
- the message body is exactly the shape FCM v1 expects, including all-string `data`
  values and the Android channel / APNs blocks;
- access tokens are cached across sends and re-exchanged when they expire;
- `UNREGISTERED` and `INVALID_ARGUMENT` are recognised as dead tokens (and the row
  deleted), while an outage is **not** — a temporary 503 must not wipe everyone's
  registrations;
- a network failure returns cleanly instead of throwing into leave approval.

`scripts/smoke-push.mjs` (24 checks) covers the device-registration side.

> Uses FCM **HTTP v1**. The old "server key" API was switched off by Google in 2024,
> so anything you read online referring to a `FCM_SERVER_KEY` is out of date.

### How it behaves

- The token is registered **after sign-in** and removed **on sign-out**, so a shared
  or handed-on phone never keeps delivering the previous user's notifications.
- Registering a token that belongs to another account **moves** it rather than
  duplicating it — one device, one owner.
- Tokens FCM reports as dead (app uninstalled) are deleted automatically.
- Deleting your account removes its device tokens with it.
- On the web, all of this is a no-op — browsers get no FCM token.

Covered by `scripts/smoke-push.mjs` (24 checks).

## Project layout

```
client/
├── capacitor.config.json   app id (uk.ac.lbc.staffhub), name, splash, status bar
├── android/                generated Android project — buildable on Windows
├── ios/                    generated iOS project  — needs a Mac
├── public/                 manifest, icons
├── tailwind.config.js      real Tailwind build (replaced the CDN)
└── src/PhoneShell.jsx      decides: decorative phone (desktop) vs full screen (device)
```

`useIsHandset()` in `PhoneShell.jsx` is the single switch — it returns true on a
screen ≤640px wide **or** whenever the app is running inside Capacitor.
