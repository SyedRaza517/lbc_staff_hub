// Remembering the sign-in details, so returning users don't retype them.
//
// The email and password are stored TOGETHER, as one record keyed to the address they
// belong to. They were separate keys with one tickbox, which desynced in a way that
// leaked a secret: teacher A signs in and signs out; teacher B opens the app, sees A's
// address with a filled password box, and either reads A's password through the reveal
// button or overwrites the address and re-saves B's email against A's password. One
// record with the owner baked in makes that state unrepresentable.
//
// WHAT STORING A PASSWORD HERE MEANS — chosen deliberately, not by accident:
//
//   • Plain text. Anything that can run script on this origin can read it. Obfuscating
//     (base64, a fixed XOR key) would be worse than nothing: the key ships in the same
//     bundle, so it stops nobody and only hides the risk from a future reviewer.
//   • It survives sign-out. That is the point — signing out and retyping would defeat
//     the feature — so on a shared machine the address stays on screen. The password
//     is NOT revealable until the user retypes it (see the login screens), so the next
//     person cannot read it, and changing the address clears it.
//   • It is cleared the moment it can no longer be right: a password change, a reset,
//     account deletion, or a 401 on that address.
//
// THE SAFER PATH, already built: turn on the biometric app lock (More → Preferences).
// The sign-in screen then offers "Sign in with Face / Fingerprint", which unlocks a
// remembered SESSION — a token that expires on its own and that the server can revoke.
// Same one-tap result, no reusable password on disk.
const KEY = "lbc_remembered_login";
// The previous email-only key. Read once for prefill so existing users don't lose
// their address, but it deliberately does NOT tick the box: everyone who had the old
// email-only "remember me" must opt in to password storage explicitly, rather than
// being silently upgraded into it by a relabelled tickbox.
