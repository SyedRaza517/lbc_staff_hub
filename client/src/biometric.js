// TWO BACKENDS, one behaviour:
//
//   native  the Capacitor plugin — Face ID, Touch ID, Android BiometricPrompt.
//   web     WebAuthn's platform authenticator — Windows Hello, Touch ID on a Mac,
//           the phone's own sensor in Chrome. Same hardware, reached through the
//           browser instead of through Capacitor.
//
// The web half exists because the dashboard is a website and the staff app is also
// served in a browser, where the Capacitor bridge simply is not present — so the
// feature used to be invisible there with nothing to explain why.
//
// A NOTE ON WHAT THIS PROVES. Neither backend is an authentication factor: there is
// no server-side challenge, and the session token is already held locally by the
// time any of this runs. Both are a LOCAL gate on the UI, exactly as a banking app's
// "unlock with Face ID" is. The account's real second factor remains TOTP. Do not
// promote either path to a login step without a server-verified WebAuthn ceremony.
